In this project, you’ll use what you know about iterating over arrays to gather information and improve the quality of a paragraph.

# Tasks

**1** In main.js, the story variable holds the paragraph we’ll be editing. In order to edit the story, we turn it into an array on line 3. The .split() method separates the story string by the space character (' ') and stores each word as an element of the array.

To see the array we’ll be working with throughout the lesson, log storyWords to the console.

After you’ve viewed the storyWords array, comment out the console.log() statement before moving to the next task.

**2** For a better visual comparison of the original and edited stories, we want to view the edited storyWords array as a string. To change the storyWords array back into a readable string, we can invoke the .join() method on storyWords.

Give the .join() method an argument of an empty space character (' ') to separate each array element with a space in the string.

Place the .join() method invocation as an argument of a console.log() statement to log the final story to the console.
